:wave: Hi! I'm Ben, a senior software consultant located in central Iowa. 

I am passionate about learning about new technologies and solving tough problems that are thrown my way. 

* 🚀 I love working with all types of technologies. Recently, this has been Python and Typescript/React in the Generative AI space
* ☁️ Cloud computing and Infrastructure as Code are must-haves on projects that I pick up
* 🖥️ Outside of cloud computing, I maintain a resiliant home lab to hone these skills outside of cloud providers
* 🧠 I am currently learning about creating rich web applications using the Elixir Phoenix Framework
